## Welcome!

Nice to meet you! I'm a Mac client platform engineer, software deployment automator, open-source contributor, frequent conference speaker, aviation enthusiast, tourist, and occasional drummer. I work at Netflix.

You can reach me by email ([elliot@elliotjordan.com](mailto:elliot@elliotjordan.com)), find me on MacAdmins Slack ([@elliotjordan](https://app.slack.com/client/T04QVKUQG/C0533K6HC/user_profile/U063VGCDV)), and browse my open-source projects on GitHub ([@homebysix](https://github.com/homebysix)).

## Corrections

Found a typo in one of my posts and want to fix it? First, thank you!

You can submit a pull request to my site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/homebysix/ejdotcom) for any corrections. You'll find a small `</>` link at the bottom of every page that will take you directly to that page's source file.
